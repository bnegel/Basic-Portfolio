                <p>Barbara is a teacher, writer, editor, and consultant who is happiest bridging the worlds of business, technology, and arts/humanities. She has published a number of children's books as well as poetry in various journals including <i>Northeast Corridor</i> and <i>Lavender Review</i>. She is the book reviewer for <i>Light</i>, an online journal of light verse, and her stage adaptation of Virginia Woolf's short story, "'Slater's Pins Have No Points'" will be published later this year in <i>Katherine Mansfield Studies</i>.</p>
                <p>In her business life, Barbara has been a qualitative consumer researcher specializing in sensitive topics, a marketing and web copywriter, and a business presentation trainer and coach. Oh, and for fun, she teaches English at Harold Washington College.</p>
                <p>Barbara has a BA in comparative literature from the University of Illinois and an MALit from Northwestern University, with concentrations in performance studies, early modern literature, and modernism. She is currently a student in Northwestern's full-stack Coding Boot Camp. She hopes to be able to apply this learning to a job that links her consumer reserach and writing skills with her (eventual) understanding of web functionality. She also hopes to apply these skills in the world of digital humanities.</p>
                <p>She lives in Chicago with a wonderful wife, a large, goofy dog, and several hundred books.</p>
